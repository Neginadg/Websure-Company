```

From: {{from_name}}

```

## 5. Update Environment Variables

2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

```env
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_abc123
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_xyz789
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=user_abcdef123456
```

## 6. Test the Form

1. Start the development server: `npm start`
2. Navigate to the Contact page
3. Fill out and submit the form
4. Check your email for the test message

## Security Notes

- The public key is safe to expose in client-side code
- EmailJS handles the secure email sending on their servers
- Your actual email credentials are never exposed in the frontend code

## Troubleshooting

- **403 Forbidden**: Check that your public key is correct
- **Template not found**: Verify the template ID matches exactly
- **Service not found**: Ensure the service ID is correct and the service is active
- **Email not received**: Check spam folder and verify email template settings

## Rate Limits

- Free tier: 200 emails/month
- Check EmailJS pricing for higher limits if needed
